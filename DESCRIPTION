Description: Tests for Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and
    communalities in a dataset. It provides a final sample by removing
    variables in a iterable manner while keeping account of the variables
    that were removed in each step. It follows the best practices and assumptions according to
    Hair, Black, Babin & Anderson (2018, ISBN:9781473756540).
